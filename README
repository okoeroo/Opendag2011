This is an implementation around jQTouch and works excellently on iPhones/iPod
Touches and Androids. All other HTML5 based (mobile and non-mobile) browsers
will work perfectly too. Unfortunately I couldn't test on various Nokias and
Blackberry's to observe how it works, but as most of them are using the WebKit
rendering engine I'm quite confident to be a success there too.

It was used as a WebApp for the Openday (Opendag) at Nikhef on October 8, 2011.
